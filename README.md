To practice my frontend CSS styling I completed the [QR Code Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) from Frontend Mentor.


I was provided with a design file as seen in the picture above and I tweaked the challenge a bit by creating my own QR code that links to my github page.
